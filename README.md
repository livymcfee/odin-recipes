Odin recipes

This project is going to be a website for recipes...I assume?? I am excited to do my first project. I have been working on learning Github and how to commit saves. I am practicing command line and typing in general. This is all new to me, but it is exciting. I have just used the terminal to open this README file, which is pretty cool. Also, I cloned the repository to my computer for remote access. The main topic I have been studying today is how to write a good commit message.
